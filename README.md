     BACK END- MySQL MVC, Spring boot.
     TESTING TOOLS- Postman for back-end front-end interaction.

Approach taken:
     To develop this Book Management application, backend functionality developed with Java Spring boot where all fields for structure were defined. Fields were mapped with MySql database for all CRUD (Create, read, update, delete) operations. Frontend layout was designed first and used service methods such as retrieve books, add book, delete book, update book which runs axios to retrieve, update, create or delete data in the database. Authentication service used to validate user credentials by using session storage functionality so that respective userâ€™s booklist is presented.
